Brag Sheet:
--
1. The thing I am most proud of is my experience in leadership within mutliple arenas. I am not known just for being a mere follower or member, but rather the person who speaks out first, who motivates others, and who becomes a good example for many.
   - Captain of Freshman Soccer
   - Captain of JV soccer (captain role varied throughout season)
   - Captain of club soccer team- East Brunswick Warriors Soccer Club
   - President of Social Studies Honors Society
   - Comittee Board Spot for Student Council and International Club
   
2. Another thing I am very proud of are my academic and athletic accomplishments. I have over a 4.0 GPA, being a consistent (A-) student throughout my highshcool career. In addition, I have played soccer for about 14 years, winning mutliple college show-case tournaments and a few state/regional cups with my club soccer team, onto my high school Varsity team where we recently won the GMCs this year!

3. Another aspect I was very prosperous in throughout high school was my ability to maintain membership in mutliple clubs and volunteer organizations. 
    - I have done many, many, many hours of community service for instituions such as the Senior Citizen Center or the New Brunswick Public Library.
    - I have also volunteered among smaller organizations such as National Honors Society, Youth Council, EB Tecs, Social Studies Honors Society, and English Honors Society.
    - I also interned/volunteered for my mother's business, "MOLD'S AND THINGS," during the Summer of my sophomore year where I trained in the field of new product development and marketing items to multiple E-commerce platforms, including Amazon and eBay. I was responsible for adding new products to the E-commerce business and generating further traffic towards these new products launched by the company.
  
Aspirations:
--
Personally, I cannot imagine myself having a desk job or working in a cubicle, and I mean no offense to anyone who does, but based on the person I notice I have become, that is not for me. I want to do something different, combine the intellectual and atheltic parts of me, and hopefully do service in the millitary as an officer, and I hope my efforts of getting into the military academies will help me to do so. Recently this year, I applied to Air Force Academy Summer Seminar, which has around an 8% acceptance rate, like many Ivy League schools, and I got in! Unfortunately, it was declared canceled due to the Covid-19 crisis, but I now have motivation to work harder and get into the actual Academy next year!
